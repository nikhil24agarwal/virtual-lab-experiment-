          <li>When the user enters this page, they will firstly see the option of a new graph, 
              clicking on it will generate a graph on random basis from the already fed 3 graphs 
              in the system containing 5 nodes.</li>
          <li>	
              As soon as the new graph is added, the tables below the graph
              (one table for each node) will automatically get updated depicting the connected nodes.</li>
          <li>
            If the user wishes to add an extra edge they can do so by 
            specifying the from and to destination along with the weight to connect the two nodes.
          </li>
          <li>
        	After the new edges have been added, the table will once again get updated accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            	Lastly the user has to end the information for sending the data packet, i.e. by specifying the
             source node and destination node in the space provided on the right hand side of our webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            The best path will be chosen and displayed to the user using red lines.
