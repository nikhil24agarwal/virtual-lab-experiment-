    <h1 class="heading">Theory:</h1>
    <p class="routingtheory"><span class="indent">Routing</span> protocols, according to the OSI routing framework, are layer management protocols for the network layer that specify 
        how routers communicate with each other to distribute information and data that helps them to select routes between any two
         nodes on a computer network.  Data packets are forwarded through the networks of the internet from one router to the other
          router until they reach their destination computer. Each router has a prior knowledge only of networks(nodes) attached to it directly.
         A routing protocol shares this information first among itâ€™s immediate neighbours, and then throughout the network.<br><br>
         There Are various Algorithms used for this, some of them discussed in our project are:<br>
         Routing is divided into two categories: </p>
         <ol>
             <li>Static Routing</li>
             <li>Dynamic Routing</li>
             <ul>
                 <li>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) </li>
                 <li>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</li>
                 <li>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</li>

             </ul>
         </ol>
    <h3>Static Routing:</h3>
    <p class="routingtheory" ><span class="indent">Static</span> routing is a form of routing that is used when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than information that
         gets updated dynamically(automatically). Unlike dynamic routing, static routes remain fixed and do not show any changes if the network 
         is changed or if it is reconfigured. Static routing and dynamic routing can be found not to mutually exclusive. Both dynamic routing and
          static routing can be used on a router to maximize routing efficiency and to provide backups in the cases that dynamic routing information 
          fails to be automatically updated. Static routing is generally used to define an exit point (default route) from a router in situations 
        when no other routes can be found available. Static routing can be used for small networks that require only one or two links.</p>
