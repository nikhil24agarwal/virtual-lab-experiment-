    <p class="routingtheory"><span class="indent">Routing</span> protocols, according to the OSI routing framework, are layer management protocols for the network layer that specify 
        how routers communicate with each other to distribute information and data that helps them to select routes between any two
         nodes on a computer network.  Data packets are forwarded through the networks of the internet from one router to the other
          router until they reach their destination computer. Each router has a prior knowledge only of networks(nodes) attached to it directly.
         A routing protocol shares this information first among it’s immediate neighbours, and then throughout the network.<br><br>
         There Are various Algorithms used for this, some of them discussed in our project are:<br>
         Routing is divided into two categories: </p>
         <ol>
             <li>Static Routing</li>
             <li>Dynamic Routing</li>
             <ul>
                 <li>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) </li>
                 <li>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</li>
                 <li>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</li>

             </ul>
         </ol>
    <h3>Static Routing:</h3>
    <p class="routingtheory" ><span class="indent">Static</span> routing is a form of routing that is used when a router uses a manually-configured routing entry, rather than information that
         gets updated dynamically(automatically). Unlike dynamic routing, static routes remain fixed and do not show any changes if the network 
         is changed or if it is reconfigured. Static routing and dynamic routing can be found not to mutually exclusive. Both dynamic routing and
          static routing can be used on a router to maximize routing efficiency and to provide backups in the cases that dynamic routing information 
          fails to be automatically updated. Static routing is generally used to define an exit point (default route) from a router in situations 
        when no other routes can be found available. Static routing can be used for small networks that require only one or two links.</p>
    <h3>Dynamic Routing:</h3>
    <div>
    <img src="images/protocol.jpg">
    <p class="dynamic">
        Dynamic router, also called adaptive routing, is a process whereby a router can transmit data through a different 
        route or on the one it is assigned depending on the current state of the communication circuits within the system.
         Dynamic routing uses complex routing algorithms that do not provide high security like static routing. When the
          network change occurs, it sends the message to the router to ensure that the routes are then recalculated for
           sending updated routing information. In short, dynamic routing is automated and does not require 
        information to be entered manually like static routing. Dynamic routing is usually implemented in large networks.

    <h2 style="margin-left: 0;">i) Routing information Protocol (RIP)</h2>
        <p class="rip"> Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is an implementation of the distance vector protocol. Routing Information 
             (RIP) is one of the oldest dynamic routing protocols which uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path 
             between the source and the destination network. Updates (routing information) is broadcasted, 
            sending the entire updated table, the information is updated periodically .It works on the principle of Bellman Ford Algorithm.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 style="margin-left:20px;">ii) Open Shortest Path First(OSPF)</h2>
            <p class="rip">Open Shortest Path First is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol networks. 
                It works on the link state routing algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols, 
                operating inside a single autonomous system. It works on the principle of Dijkstra's algorithm, also known
                 as the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm . OSPF uses the flooding  technique that is, it checks all
                possible routes between source and destination and picks the shortest route(best route).
